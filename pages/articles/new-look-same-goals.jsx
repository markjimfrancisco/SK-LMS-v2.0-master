            Introducing the new Stock Knowledge logo
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Anyone can define ‘stock knowledge’ but we have given it an entirely
            new and progressive meaning.
            <br />
            <br />
            When Stock Knowledge first started in September 2016, we ran on only
            two sources of fuel: our determination to be a gamechanger in the
            educational technology industry and the genuine passion to help
            students across the local academic sector have a new-found
            appreciation for learning. Little did we know that in just less than
            five years, we would eventually evolve into a dynamic team of driven
            professionals that can offer highly sustainable innovations and
            bigger benefits to each of our stakeholders on a broader scale.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, we are proud to unveil our new logo which perfectly
            represents the growth we have achieved so far. While we embrace new
            developments and brighter outlooks moving forward, we are still
            anchored on the same mission, vision, and values that have made
            Stock Knowledge one of the premier educational technology providers
            in the country: to create breakthrough software innovations that
            meet the demands of modern education; help raise the standard of
            learning for students around the world; and vow to perform our
            functions with utmost excellence, efficiency, integrity, creativity,
            and loyalty at all times.
            <br />
            <img
              className="mx-auto my-8"
              src="/images/articles/new-look-same-goal/image-1.svg"
            />
            <br />
            Perhaps, our new logo can best expound on this.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
            All elements matter
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            We have meticulously chosen every detail that makes up our new logo
            just as how we painstakingly provide worthy solutions to our
            clientele. After studying how color psychology works, we have come
            up with primary hues in our palette that not only represent the many
            branches of academic study but also tell of our inclusive approach
            in helping all students across standard education phases and modes.
            <br />
            <br />
            The green represents Science; the yellow for Engineering; and the
            red for Math; all blending into the main blue that signifies
            cutting-edge technology– just as how the Stock Knowledge platform
            has finally evolved into today.
            <br />
            <br />
            More than the colors, our team of creatives likewise ensured that
            the tone for our new logo both tells of our story (two books stacked
            on top of one another as our continuing process of uncovering new
            technologies and methods of teaching), while also upholding our
            appeal to our various audiences– the students, educators, parents,
            investors, partners, and colleagues.
            <img
              className="mx-auto my-8"
              src="/images/articles/new-look-same-goal/image-2.svg"
            />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
            Driven towards new horizons in education and technology
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            By continually extending our capabilities and knowledge power to
            address the pain points of those we cater via a patient, and
            encouraging manner, we let students of every age or every faculty
            member know that we too can speak their languages and are ready to
            work together towards greater developments.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is because we acknowledge 19that developing new standards in
            education requires everyone’s help. We cannot just draw up a plan
            and not provide avenues for communication because all the voices
            within the education spectrum are all important. This is why our
            logo’s various elements– from the colors and fonts to the entire
            design, represent the many change agents who need to get involved in
            creating great strides in global education’s progress.
            <br />
            <br />
            With our new logo best encapsulating our current achievements,
            stand, and onward direction, there’s no question how we at Stock
            Knowledge recognize how we can further boost our innovations not
            only with great passion and determination, but also with a
            collective mindset that is tech-driven, bright, and dynamic. All
            this fuel propelling us into the future as we pursue our goal of
            better and more engaging education for every student.
